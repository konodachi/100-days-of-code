### Day 1: August 13th, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've done some challenges on FreeCodeCamp and completed a challenge on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Javascript is hard to understand sometimes but it's lots of fun. It was fun seeing the things I do in 30 lines can actually be done in 3.

### Day 2: August 14th, Tuesday
**Today's Progress**: Did Duplicate Encoder kata on Codewars and Studied Regex on Freecodecamp

**Thoughts**: This is getting fun! Excited for what I'll be able to build once I finish JavaScript and Algorithms Certification.

### Day 3: August 15th, Wednesday
**Today's Progress**: Finished the final Regex challenges on Freecodecamp.

**Thoughts**: I didn't expect regular expressions to be challenging at all. I had too look up some answers but realized I only forgot some bits here and there but I understood the important concepts. Totally satisfied with my learning.
