# 100 Days Of Code - Log


### Day 1: August 13th, Monday
**Today's Progress**: I've done some challenges on FreeCodeCamp and completed a challenge on Codewars.

**Thoughts**: Javascript is hard to understand sometimes but it's lots of fun. It was fun seeing the things I do in 30 lines can actually be done in 3.

**Links to Work**: [Reversing Strings](https://www.codewars.com/users/konodachi/completed_solutions)
